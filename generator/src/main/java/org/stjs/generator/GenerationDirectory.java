/**
 * This class is used to provide the different parts of the target directory:
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 *     the absolute path to the directory in which the generated .js source files are placed (during generation)
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *     the part relative to the project's directory used when the classpath for tests is built
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *     the path in the classpath of the final artifact in which the generated .js source files are placed. That path can then be used
 *     to load the generated .js files using Class.getResource() or ClassLoader.getResource(). That path is saved within the .stjs files
 *     and will be used later on, for example when this project is used as a dependency - jar/war
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * The 3 parts are different for the files generated for the main classes compared to the test classes
